Simple Docker image containing a Git server accessible via SSH.

Image source at: https://github.com/rockstorm101/git-server-docker.


## Basic Usage

```
docker run -v git-repositories:/srv/git -p 2222:22 rockstorm/git-server
```

Your server should be accessible on port 2222 via:

```
git clone ssh://git@localhost:2222/srv/git/your-repo.git
```

The default password for the git user is `12345`.


## Other Features

The image allows much more use cases which are detailed in the [source
README][2]:
 - Setup custom passwords
 - Use SSH public keys
 - Setup custom host SSH keys
 - Enable Git URLs without an absolute path
 - Disable git user interactive login
 - Set git user UID and GID

## Security Warning

The default host keys are generated during image build and are the same for every container which uses this image.
This is a security risk and therefore the use of a custom set of keys is highly recommended.
This will also ensure keys are persistent if the image is upgraded.
